## About

**Analyzed a large randomized controlled trial aimed to determine the impact of acupuncture therapy on headache severity. These measures were assessed in three different time points: at randomization, 3 months post-randomization, and 1 year post-randomization. The data was obtained from [Acupunture Dataset](http://www.causeweb.org/tshs/acupuncture/)**

## Overall Summary

We have sufficient evidence to claim the population (control and acupuncture treatment combined) experienced a decrease in headache severity from baseline (at randoimization) to 3 months post-randomization. From our parametric paired t-test we can claim there was strong evidence at a 99% confidence interval that the population had, on average, 3-6 less headaches over the 3 months. Between the parametric and nonparametric inference procedure, the results did not change and both tests concluded that we had sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Furthermore, the acupuncture treatment group saw a larger decrease in headache severity compared to the control group. From the results of the two-sample t-test (p-value: 0.003 < 0.05, CI: (2.4, 6.4)), and our test statistic of ~2.4 not included in the 95% confidence interval, along with the results of the rank sum test (p-value: 0.001 < 0.05), we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude the change in headache severity was different between the control and treatment group.
